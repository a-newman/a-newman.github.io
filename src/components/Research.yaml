        abstract: A key capability of an intelligent decision making system is to decipher which events should be remembered, which ones can be forgotten and when to make an intervention to revive a decaying memory. Here, we model for the first time the human memory decay of visual events. We propose a new mathematical formulation of memorability decay and create a multimodal model that combines visual and semantic information to fully represent the meaning of events. We show that our model can estimate with high accuracy both the memorability strength of a video clip and its decay curve. Our model establishes new state of the art performances in predicting the memorability of events and how long a given memory will last.

        abstract: "Eye movements provide insight into what parts of an image a viewer finds most salient, interesting, or relevant to the task at hand. Unfortunately, eye tracking data, a commonly-used proxy for attention, is cumbersome to collect. Here we explore an alternative: a comprehensive web-based toolbox for crowdsourcing visual attention. We draw from four main classes of attention-capturing methodologies in the literature. ZoomMaps is a novel <i>zoom-based</i> interface that captures viewing on a mobile phone. CodeCharts is a <i>self-reporting</i> methodology that records points of interest at precise viewing durations. ImportAnnots is an <i>annotation</i> tool for selecting important image regions, and <i>cursor-based</i> BubbleView lets viewers click to deblur a small area. We compare these methodologies using a common analysis framework in order to develop appropriate use cases for each interface. This toolbox and our analyses provide a blueprint for how to gather attention data at scale without an eye tracker."
