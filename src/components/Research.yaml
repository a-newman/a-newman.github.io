        imageAlt: Memorability decay predictions from our model, SemanticMemNet
        abstract: A key capability of an intelligent system is deciding when events from past experience must be remembered and when they can be forgotten. Towards this goal, we develop a predictive model of human visual event memory and how those memories decay over time. We introduce Memento10k, a new, dynamic video memorability dataset containing human annotations at different viewing delays. Based on our findings we propose a new mathematical formulation of memorability decay, resulting in a model that is able to produce the first quantitative estimation of how a video decays in memory over time. In contrast with previous work, our model can predict the probability that a video will be remembered at an arbitrary delay. Importantly, our approach is multimodal, combining visual and semantic information to fully represent the meaning of events. Our experiments on two video memorability benchmarks, including Memento10k, show that our model significantly improves upon the best prior approach (by 12% on average).

        videoAlt: "Teaser explaining the 4 TurkEyes interfaces"
        abstract: "Eye movements provide insight into what parts of an image a viewer finds most salient, interesting, or relevant to the task at hand. Unfortunately, eye tracking data, a commonly-used proxy for attention, is cumbersome to collect. Here we explore an alternative: a comprehensive web-based toolbox for crowdsourcing visual attention. We draw from four main classes of attention-capturing methodologies in the literature. ZoomMaps is a novel <i>zoom-based</i> interface that captures viewing on a mobile phone. CodeCharts is a <i>self-reporting</i> methodology that records points of interest at precise viewing durations. ImportAnnots is an <i>annotation</i> tool for selecting important image regions, and <i>cursor-based</i> BubbleView lets viewers click to deblur a small area. We compare these methodologies using a common analysis framework in order to develop appropriate use cases for each interface. This toolbox and our analyses provide a blueprint for how to gather attention data at scale without an eye tracker."
